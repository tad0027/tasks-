| For example, we may only be interested in the first 20 elements of a vector,

| The way you tell R that you want to select some particular elements (i.e. a
| 'subset') from a vector is by placing an 'index vector' in square brackets
| immediately following the name of the vector.

| Index vectors come in four different flavors -- logical vectors, vectors of
| positive integers, vectors of negative integers, and vectors of character
| strings -- each of which we'll cover in this lesson.

| Let's start by indexing with logical vectors. One common scenario when
| working with real-world data is that we want to extract all elements of a
| vector that are not NA (i.e. missing data). Recall that is.na(x) yields a
| vector of logical values the same length as x, with TRUEs corresponding to NA
| values in x and FALSEs corresponding to non-NA values in x.

| Recall that `!` gives us the negation of a logical expression, so !is.na(x)
| can be read as 'is not NA'. Therefore, if we want to create a vector called y
| that contains all of the non-NA values from x, we can use y <- x[!is.na(x)].
| Give it a try.

| I've already shown you how to subset just the first ten values of x using
| x[1:10]. In this case, we're providing a vector of positive integers inside
| of the square brackets, which tells R to return only the elements of x
| numbered 1 through 10.

  |                                                                              |==================================                                    |  49%
| Many programming languages use what's called 'zero-based indexing', which
| means that the first element of a vector is considered element 0. R uses
| 'one-based indexing', which (you guessed it!) means the first element of a
| vector is considered element 1.

| Can you figure out how we'd subset the 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements of x? Hint
| -- Use the c() function to specify the element numbers as a numeric vector.

| It's important that when using integer vectors to subset our vector x, we
| stick with the set of indexes {1, 2, ..., 40} since x only has 40 elements.
| What happens if we ask for the zeroth element of x (i.e. x[0])? Give it a

| Again, nothing useful, but R doesn't prevent us from asking for it. This
| should be a cautionary tale. You should always make sure that what you are
| asking for is within the bounds of the vector you're working with.

| What if we're interested in all elements of x EXCEPT the 2nd and 10th? It
| would be pretty tedious to construct a vector containing all numbers 1

...

  |                                                                              |=============================================                         |  64%

| You're the best!

  |                                                                              |================================================                      |  69%
| So far, we've covered three types of index vectors -- logical, positive
| integer, and negative integer. The only remaining type requires us to
| introduce the concept of 'named' elements.

...

  |                                                                              |==================================================                    |  72%
| Create a numeric vector with three named elements using vect <- c(foo = 11,
| bar = 2, norf = NA).

> vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA)

| You nailed it! Good job!

  |                                                                              |====================================================                  |  74%
| When we print vect to the console, you'll see that each element has a name.
| Try it out.

> vect
 foo  bar norf 
  11    2   NA 

| You are really on a roll!

  |                                                                              |======================================================                |  77%
| We can also get the names of vect by passing vect as an argument to the
| names() function. Give that a try.

> names(vect)
[1] "foo"  "bar"  "norf"

| You are amazing!

  |                                                                              |========================================================              |  79%
| Alternatively, we can create an unnamed vector vect2 with c(11, 2, NA). Do
| that now.

> vect2 <- c(11, 2, NA)

| You got it right!

  |                                                                              |=========================================================             |  82%
| Then, we can add the `names` attribute to vect2 after the fact with
| names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf"). Go ahead.

> names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")

| Excellent work!

  |                                                                              |===========================================================           |  85%
| Now, let's check that vect and vect2 are the same by passing them as
| arguments to the identical() function.

> indentical(vect, vect2)
Error in indentical(vect, vect2) : could not find function "indentical"
> identical(vect, vect2)
[1] TRUE

| Excellent job!

  |                                                                              |=============================================================         |  87%
| Indeed, vect and vect2 are identical named vectors.

...

  |                                                                              |===============================================================       |  90%
| Now, back to the matter of subsetting a vector by named elements. Which of
| the following commands do you think would give us the second element of vect?

1: vect["bar"]
2: vect[bar]
3: vect["2"]

Selection: 1

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |                                                                              |=================================================================     |  92%
| Now, try it out.

> vect["bar"]
bar 
  2 

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |                                                                              |==================================================================    |  95%
| Likewise, we can specify a vector of names with vect[c("foo", "bar")]. Try it
| out.

> vect[c("foo", "bar")]
foo bar 
 11   2 

| That's correct!

  |                                                                              |====================================================================  |  97%
| Now you know all four methods of subsetting data from vectors. Different
| approaches are best in different scenarios and when in doubt, try it out!

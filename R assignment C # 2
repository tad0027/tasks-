| Thanks, Timmy Daniels. Let's cover a couple of quick housekeeping items
| before we begin our first lesson. First of all, you should know that when you
| see '...', that means you should press Enter when you are done reading and
| ready to continue.

...  <-- That's your cue to press Enter to continue

| Also, when you see 'ANSWER:', the R prompt (>), or when you are asked to
| select from a list, that means it's your turn to enter a response, then press
| Enter to continue.

Select 1, 2, or 3 and press Enter 

1: Continue.
2: Proceed.
3: Let's get going!

Selection: 1

| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the
| Esc key. If you are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your
| progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know
| you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore
| what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| Let's get started!

| In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and
| begin to explore the relationship between your workspace and the file system
| of your machine.

...

  |                                                                              |==                                                                    |   3%
| Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards
| to things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across
| machines.

...

  |                                                                              |====                                                                  |   5%
| However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of
| commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will work across
| different kinds of computers.

...

  |                                                                              |=====                                                                 |   8%
| Let's jump right in so you can get a feel for how these special functions
| work!

...

  |                                                                              |=======                                                               |  10%
| Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working
| directory using getwd().

> 
> getwd()
[1] "C:/Users/Timmy Daniels/Documents"

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |                                                                              |=========                                                             |  13%
| List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

> ()
Error: unexpected ')' in "()"
> ls()
character(0)

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |                                                                              |===========                                                           |  15%
| Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or on a
| Mac. Both Linux and Mac operating systems are based on an operating system
| called Unix. It's always a good idea to learn more about Unix!

...

  |                                                                              |=============                                                         |  18%
| Assign 9 to x using x <- 9.

> x <- 9

| You're the best!

  |                                                                              |==============                                                        |  21%
| Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

> ls()
[1] "x"

| That's a job well done!

  |                                                                              |================                                                      |  23%

| In general, you will want your working directory to be someplace sensible,

| organizing your work in R packages using RStudio is an excellent option.

| These sorts of functions are excessive for interactive use. But, if you are

| Keep trying! Or, type info() for more options.

| file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R") is the answer. Googling using key words
| from the question, along with the letter R, will often give you a good hint.

| Your operating system will provide simpler tools for these sorts of tasks,
| but having the ability to manipulate files programatically is useful. You
| might now try to delete mytest.R using file.remove('mytest.R'), but that
| won't work since mytest.R no longer exists. You have already renamed it.

| You now have two files in the current directory. That may not seem very
| interesting. But what if you were working with dozens, or millions, of
| individual files? In that case, being able to programatically act on many
| files would be absolutely necessary. Don't forget that you can, temporarily,

| You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are

| It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began an
| analysis and then go back to them at the end. This trick is often used within
| functions; you save, say, the par() settings that you started with, mess
| around a bunch, and then set them back to the original values at the end.
| This isn't the same as what we have done here, but it seems similar enough to
| mention.

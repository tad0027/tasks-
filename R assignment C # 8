| This lesson is meant to be a short introduction to logical operations in R.

...

  |                                                                              |=                                                                     |   2%
| There are two logical values in R, also called boolean values. They are TRUE
| and FALSE. In R you can construct logical expressions which will evaluate to
| either TRUE or FALSE.

...

  |                                                                              |===                                                                   |   4%
| Many of the questions in this lesson will involve evaluating logical
| expressions. It may be useful to open up a second R terminal where you can
| experiment with some of these expressions.

...

  |                                                                              |====                                                                  |   6%
| Creating logical expressions requires logical operators. You're probably
| familiar with arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. The first
| logical operator we are going to discuss is the equality operator,
| represented by two equals signs `==`. Use the equality operator below to find
| out if TRUE is equal to TRUE.

> TRUE == TRUE 
[1] TRUE

| Great job!

  |                                                                              |=====                                                                 |   8%
| Just like arithmetic, logical expressions can be grouped by parenthesis so
| that the entire expression (TRUE == TRUE) == TRUE evaluates to TRUE.

...

  |                                                                              |=======                                                               |  10%
| To test out this property, try evaluating (FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE .

> (FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE
[1] TRUE

| That's a job well done!

  |                                                                              |========                                                              |  12%
| The equality operator can also be used to compare numbers. Use `==` to see if
| 6 is equal to 7.

> 6 = 7
Error in 6 = 7 : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
> 6 == 7
[1] FALSE

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |                                                                              |=========                                                             |  13%
| The previous expression evaluates to FALSE because 6 is less than 7.
| Thankfully, there are inequality operators that allow us to test if a value
| is less than or greater than another value.

...

  |                                                                              |===========                                                           |  15%
| The less than operator `<` tests whether the number on the left side of the
| operator (called the left operand) is less than the number on the right side
| of the operator (called the right operand). Write an expression to test
| whether 6 is less than 7.

> 6 < 7
[1] TRUE

| You got it!

  |                                                                              |============                                                          |  17%
| There is also a less-than-or-equal-to operator `<=` which tests whether the
| left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. Write an expression
| to test whether 10 is less than or equal to 10.

> 10 <= 10
[1] TRUE

| You got it right!

  |                                                                              |=============                                                         |  19%
| Keep in mind that there are the corresponding greater than `>` and
| greater-than-or-equal-to `>=` operators.

...

  |                                                                              |===============                                                       |  21%

| The next operator we will discuss is the 'not equals' operator represented by
| `!=`. Not equals tests whether two values are unequal, so TRUE != FALSE
| evaluates to TRUE. Like the equality operator, `!=` can also be used with
| numbers. Try writing an expression to see if 5 is not equal to 7.

> 5 != 7
[1] TRUE

| That's a job well done!

  |                                                                              |===================                                                   |  27%
| In order to negate boolean expressions you can use the NOT operator. An
| exclamation point `!` will cause !TRUE (say: not true) to evaluate to FALSE
| and !FALSE (say: not false) to evaluate to TRUE. Try using the NOT operator
| and the equals operator to find the opposite of whether 5 is equal to 7.

> !5 == 7
[1] TRUE

| You got it!

  |                                                                              |====================                                                  |  29%
| Let's take a moment to review. The equals operator `==` tests whether two
| boolean values or numbers are equal, the not equals operator `!=` tests
| whether two boolean values or numbers are unequal, and the NOT operator `!`
| negates logical expressions so that TRUE expressions become FALSE and FALSE
| expressions become TRUE.

| Excellent work!

| At some point you may need to examine relationships between multiple logical
| expressions. This is where the AND operator and the OR operator come in.

...

  |                                                                              |==========================                                            |  37%
| Let's look at how the AND operator works. There are two AND operators in R,
| `&` and `&&`. Both operators work similarly, if the right and left operands
| of AND are both TRUE the entire expression is TRUE, otherwise it is FALSE.
| For example, TRUE & TRUE evaluates to TRUE. Try typing FALSE & FALSE to how
| it is evaluated.

> FALSE & FALSE
[1] FALSE

| You are quite good my friend!

  |                                                                              |===========================                                           |  38%
| You can use the `&` operator to evaluate AND across a vector. The `&&`
| version of AND only evaluates the first member of a vector. Let's test both
| for practice. Type the expression TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

> "TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
[1] "TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type
| info() for more options.

| Now to see how the AND operator works with a vector, type: TRUE & c(TRUE,
| FALSE, FALSE)

> "TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
[1] "TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"

| Nice try, but that's not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again. Or, type
| info() for more options.

| Now to see how the AND operator works with a vector, type: TRUE & c(TRUE,
| FALSE, FALSE)

> "TRUE | c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
[1] "TRUE | c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"

| Give it another try. Or, type info() for more options.

| Now to see how the AND operator works with a vector, type: TRUE & c(TRUE,
| FALSE, FALSE)

> TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE

| You got it right!

  |                                                                              |============================                                          |  40%
| What happens in this case is that the left operand `TRUE` is recycled across
| every element in the vector of the right operand. This is the equivalent
| statement as c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

...

  |                                                                              |==============================                                        |  42%
| Now we'll type the same expression except we'll use the `&&` operator. Type
| the expression TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

> TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
[1] TRUE

| That's a job well done!

  |                                                                              |===============================                                       |  44%
| In this case, the left operand is only evaluated with the first member of the
| right operand (the vector). The rest of the elements in the vector aren't
| evaluated at all in this expression.

...

  |                                                                              |================================                                      |  46%
| The OR operator follows a similar set of rules. The `|` version of OR
| evaluates OR across an entire vector, while the `||` version of OR only
| evaluates the first member of a vector.

...

  |                                                                              |==================================                                    |  48%
| An expression using the OR operator will evaluate to TRUE if the left operand
| or the right operand is TRUE. If both are TRUE, the expression will evaluate
| to TRUE, however if neither are TRUE, then the expression will be FALSE.

...

  |                                                                              |===================================                                   |  50%
| Let's test out the vectorized version of the OR operator. Type the expression
| TRUE | c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

> TRUE | c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE

| Excellent work!

  |                                                                              |====================================                                  |  52%
| Now let's try out the non-vectorized version of the OR operator. Type the
| expression TRUE || c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE).

> TRUE || c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
[1] TRUE

| You are really on a roll!

  |                                                                              |======================================                                |  54%
| Logical operators can be chained together just like arithmetic operators. The
| expressions: `6 != 10 && FALSE && 1 >= 2` or `TRUE || 5 < 9.3 || FALSE` are
| perfectly normal to see.

...

  |                                                                              |=======================================                               |  56%
| As you may recall, arithmetic has an order of operations and so do logical
| expressions. All AND operators are evaluated before OR operators. Let's look
| at an example of an ambiguous case. Type: 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9

> 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9
[1] TRUE

| You are really on a roll!

  |                                                                              |========================================                              |  58%
| Let's walk through the order of operations in the above case. First the left
| and right operands of the AND operator are evaluated. 6 is not equal 8, 4 is
| greater than 3.9, therefore both operands are TRUE so the resulting
| expression `TRUE && TRUE` evaluates to TRUE. Then the left operand of the OR
| operator is evaluated: 5 is not greater than 8 so the entire expression is
| reduced to FALSE || TRUE. Since the right operand of this expression is TRUE
| the entire expression evaluates to TRUE.

| You should also be aware of the xor() function, which takes two arguments.
| The xor() function stands for exclusive OR. If one argument evaluates to TRUE
| and one argument evaluates to FALSE, then this function will return TRUE,

| == 6, !FALSE)

| 5 == 6 evaluates to FALSE, !FALSE evaluates to TRUE, so xor(FALSE, TRUE)
| evaluates to TRUE. On the other hand if the first argument was changed to 5
| == 5 and the second argument was unchanged then both arguments would have
| been TRUE, so xor(TRUE, TRUE) would have evaluated to FALSE.

| For the next few questions, we're going to need to create a vector of
| integers called ints. Create this vector by typing: ints <- sample(10)

| The vector `ints` is a random sampling of integers from 1 to 10 without
| replacement. Let's say we wanted to ask some logical questions about contents
| of ints. If we type ints > 5, we will get a logical vector corresponding to
| whether each element of ints is greater than 5. Try typing: ints > 5

> ints > 5

| We can use the resulting logical vector to ask other questions about ints.
| The which() function takes a logical vector as an argument and returns the
